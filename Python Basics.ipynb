What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","\n","Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n","\n","Why Python is Popular:\n","Simple and Readable Syntax: Python‚Äôs syntax is clean and easy to understand, resembling plain English. This makes it beginner-friendly.\n","\n","Large Standard Library: It includes a wide range of modules and functions, reducing the need to write code from scratch.\n","\n","Versatility: Python is used in various fields such as:\n","\n","Web development (e.g., Django, Flask)\n","\n","Data science and machine learning (e.g., pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow)\n","\n","Automation and scripting\n","\n","Game development\n","\n","Desktop applications\n","\n","Q 2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line. Unlike compiled languages (like C or Java), which are transformed into machine code before execution, Python code is directly executed by the interpreter, making it easier to test and debug.\n","\n","Key Functions of the Python Interpreter:\n","Reads Python source code (.py files).\n","\n","Parses and converts it into bytecode (an intermediate, platform-independent representation).\n","\n","Executes the bytecode using a virtual machine (Python Virtual Machine, or PVM).\n","\n","Benefits of Using an Interpreter:\n","Interactive execution: You can run Python code directly in the terminal or IDLE.\n","\n","Quick testing: Great for beginners and rapid development.\n","\n","Platform independence: The same Python code can run on different operating systems with the appropriate interpreter installed.\n","\n","Popular Python interpreters include:\n","\n","CPython (default and most widely used)\n","\n","PyPy (faster execution with JIT compilation)\n","\n","Jython (runs Python on the Java platform)\n","\n","IronPython (runs on .NET)\n","\n","\n","Q 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning to the Python interpreter. These keywords are part of the Python language syntax and cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names, function names, etc.).\n","\n","Key Points About Python Keywords:\n","They are case-sensitive (True ‚â† true)\n","\n","They control the flow and structure of Python programs\n","\n","There are 35+ keywords in Python 3.x (as of recent versions)\n","\n","Examples of Common Python Keywords:\n","Keyword\tPurpose\n","if, else, elif\tConditional statements\n","for, while, break, continue\tLoops and control flow\n","def, return\tFunction definition and output\n","class\tDefine a class (OOP)\n","try, except, finally, raise\tError handling\n","import, from, as\tImporting modules\n","True, False, None\tBoolean and null values\n","and, or, not, in, is\tLogical operators\n","with, lambda, pass, yield, global, nonlocal\tMiscellaneous control.\n","\n","\n","Q 4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","o, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n","\n","Why?\n","Because keywords have special meanings in the language syntax. Using them as variable names would confuse the interpreter and cause a syntax error.\n","\n","Example:\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","if = 10      # ‚ùå Invalid: 'if' is a keyword\n","print = \"Hi\" # ‚ùå Invalid in some cases (overwrites built-in function)\n","What happens if you try?\n","You'll get an error like:\n","\n","javascript\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n","Tip:\n","If you're unsure whether a word is a keyword, you can check it using:\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","import keyword\n","print(keyword.iskeyword(\"if\"))  # Output: True\n","\n","Q 5. What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","Mutability in Python refers to whether or not an object‚Äôs state (or content) can be changed after it is created.\n","\n","Types of Objects in Terms of Mutability:\n","Type\tMutability\tExample\n","Mutable\tCan be changed\tlist, dict, set, bytearray\n","Immutable\tCannot be changed\tint, float, str, tuple, bool, frozenset\n","\n","Mutable Example (List):\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","my_list[0] = 10\n","print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3]\n","The list was changed in place.\n","\n","Immutable Example (String):\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","my_str = \"hello\"\n","my_str[0] = \"H\"  # ‚ùå This will raise an error\n","You can't change part of a string ‚Äî instead, you must create a new string:\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","new_str = \"H\" + my_str[1:]\n","Why Does Mutability Matter?\n","It affects performance, memory use, and behavior in functions.\n","\n","Mutable default arguments in functions can lead to unexpected bugs.\n","\n","Q 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","1. Purpose and Use Case\n","Lists are designed to store collections of items that may need to change. You can add, remove, or modify elements‚Äîideal for dynamic data structures.\n","\n","Tuples are designed for fixed collections of items. They're often used for data that shouldn't change, like function arguments or records.\n","\n","2. Memory and Performance\n","Tuples can be optimized by Python because their immutability guarantees stability. For example, they can be used as keys in dictionaries or stored in sets‚Äîsomething lists can‚Äôt do.\n","\n","Lists need more flexible memory handling because their contents can change.\n","\n","3. Hashability\n","Tuples can be hashable (if all their elements are hashable), meaning they can be used as dictionary keys.\n","\n","Lists are not hashable because they can change, which would make dictionary lookups unreliable.\n","\n","4. Safety\n","Immutability protects data integrity. Once a tuple is created, its content can‚Äôt be accidentally modified.\n","\n","Mutability allows greater flexibility but comes with risks like unintended side effects in functions if lists are modified in-place.\n","\n","Q 7 What is the difference between ‚Äú==‚Äù and ‚Äúis‚Äù operators in Python\n","\n","In Python, == and is are both comparison operators but serve different purposes:\n","\n","1. == (Equality Operator)\n","Purpose: Checks if values of two objects are equal.\n","\n","Usage: a == b returns True if a and b have the same value.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","a = [1, 2, 3]\n","b = [1, 2, 3]\n","print(a == b)  # True (values are the same)\n","2. is (Identity Operator)\n","Purpose: Checks if two references point to the same object in memory.\n","\n","Usage: a is b returns True if a and b are the same object.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","a = [1, 2, 3]\n","b = [1, 2, 3]\n","print(a is b)  # False (different objects in memory)\n","Another Example with Integers:\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","x = 1000\n","y = 1000\n","print(x == y)  # True (same value)\n","print(x is y)  # False (different objects, usually for large ints)\n","\n","Q 8 What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements (expressions that evaluate to True or False). There are three main logical operators:\n","\n","1. and\n","Returns True if both conditions are True.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","a = 10\n","b = 5\n","print(a > 5 and b < 10)  # True\n","2. or\n","Returns True if at least one condition is True.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","a = 10\n","b = 15\n","print(a < 5 or b > 10)  # True\n","3. not\n","Reverses the boolean value of the condition.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","a = 10\n","print(not (a > 5))  # False\n","\n","Q 9 What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","Type casting in Python refers to converting a value from one data type to another. It's commonly used when you need to perform operations on variables of different types or when user input needs to be converted.\n","\n","Types of Type Casting in Python:\n","1. Implicit Type Casting (Done Automatically by Python)\n","Python automatically converts one data type to another when no data loss occurs.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","a = 5        # int\n","b = 2.0      # float\n","result = a + b\n","print(result)      # 7.0\n","print(type(result))  # <class 'float'>\n","2. Explicit Type Casting (Done Manually by the Programmer)\n","You convert the type using built-in functions.\n","\n","Common casting functions:\n","\n","int()\n","\n","float()\n","\n","str()\n","\n","bool()\n","\n","list(), tuple(), set()\n","\n","Examples:\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","x = \"100\"\n","y = int(x)  # Convert string to int\n","print(y + 10)  # 110\n","\n","a = 3.14\n","b = int(a)  # Converts to 3 (truncates decimal)\n","print(b)\n","üö´ Be Careful:\n","Not all conversions are valid. For example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","int(\"abc\")  # ‚ùå Raises ValueError\n","\n","Q 10 What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n","\n","The difference between implicit and explicit type casting in Python lies in who performs the conversion and how controlled it is:\n","\n","üîπ 1. Implicit Type Casting\n","Performed by Python automatically\n","\n","Happens without any manual instruction\n","\n","Ensures no data loss, usually when combining different numeric types\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","x = 5       # int\n","y = 2.5     # float\n","result = x + y  # x is implicitly converted to float\n","print(result)   # 7.5\n","print(type(result))  # <class 'float'>\n","2. Explicit Type Casting\n","Manually done by the programmer\n","\n","Uses built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n","\n","Useful when you want to control or force the type conversion\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","x = \"10\"\n","y = int(x)   # Explicitly converting string to int\n","print(y + 5)  # 15\n","\n","Q 11 What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","\n","The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of execution in a program based on certain conditions. They allow your program to make decisions‚Äîjust like how humans decide what to do based on different situations.\n","\n","Why Use Conditional Statements?\n","To execute code only if a certain condition is true\n","\n","To choose between multiple actions\n","\n","To add logic and decision-making to programs.\n","\n","Q 12 How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","The elif statement in Python stands for \"else if\" and is used to check multiple conditions in a sequence‚Äîafter an if statement and before an else.\n","\n","Python evaluates conditions from top to bottom.\n","\n","The first if or elif that evaluates to True gets executed.\n","\n","Once a condition is True, the rest of the elif and else blocks are skipped.\n","\n","Q 12 What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","\n","The difference between for and while loops in Python lies in how and when the loop condition is evaluated and controlled:\n","\n","1. for Loop\n","Used when you know in advance how many times to loop.\n","\n","Iterates over a sequence (like a list, string, or range)\n","\n","2. while Loop\n","Used when you don't know in advance how many times to loop.\n","\n","Continues as long as the condition is True.\n","\n","Q 14  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","\n","A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when you don't know in advance how many times the loop needs to run‚Äîi.e., when the loop should continue based on a condition that depends on runtime behavior.\n","\n","want to repeatedly prompt a user to enter the correct password. You don‚Äôt know how many attempts they‚Äôll take‚Äîso a while loop is ideal.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","correct_password = \"open123\"\n","user_input = \"\"\n","\n","while user_input != correct_password:\n","    user_input = input(\"Enter password: \")\n","\n","print(\"Access granted.\")\n","Why not a for loop?\n","You don't want to limit them to a fixed number of tries unless you explicitly define a maximum. while gives the flexibility to loop until the condition is met.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tnYI5rThTicD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# New Section"],"metadata":{"id":"2JWNLaJ4Uqsl"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Practical Question:-\n","\n","Q 1 Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!y?\n","\n","\"Hello, World!\"\n","\n","print(\"Hello, World\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"kEAlLT9zWsCY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746531198213,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"Richa Singh","userId":"01386615100736677143"}},"outputId":"a155b8d7-6a18-47c5-c7a1-74199cd3ce93"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Object `y` not found.\n","Hello, World\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# New Section"],"metadata":{"id":"FnSknXY_X5fh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"BRWO9VRdUPGk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Q 2 Write a Python program that displays your name and age?\n","\n","name = \"Alice\"\n","age = 30\n","\n","print(\"My name is\", name)\n","print(\"I am\", age, \"years old\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"N9CRm03xMZOt","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746612204206,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":30,"user":{"displayName":"Richa Singh","userId":"01386615100736677143"}},"outputId":"51c46fa2-4e20-4592-e2dd-784f76ccea12"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Object `age` not found.\n","My name is Alice\n","I am 30 years old\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Q 3 Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using the keyword library?\n","\n","import keyword\n","\n","keywords = keyword.kwlist\n","\n","print(\"Python Keywords:\")\n","for kw in keywords:\n","    print(kw)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"WM9gHjqSMweW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746612323395,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":22,"user":{"displayName":"Richa Singh","userId":"01386615100736677143"}},"outputId":"a6f79940-c2f5-49d1-a984-cba4fba5d9a8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Object `library` not found.\n","Python Keywords:\n","False\n","None\n","True\n","and\n","as\n","assert\n","async\n","await\n","break\n","class\n","continue\n","def\n","del\n","elif\n","else\n","except\n","finally\n","for\n","from\n","global\n","if\n","import\n","in\n","is\n","lambda\n","nonlocal\n","not\n","or\n","pass\n","raise\n","return\n","try\n","while\n","with\n","yield\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"LpWxTURzNbxk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Q 4  Write a program that checks if a given word is a Python keyword.\n","\n","import keyword  #
